# Email Loading Issue Fix Guide

## Problem
The application is showing "unknown@unknown.com" instead of real email addresses from the database.

## Root Cause
The issue occurs in the [AdminUserService](file:///C:/Users/BILLA/Downloads/appwithpasswordchange%20(%20002)/lib/admin-user-service.ts#L42-L628) class where the application attempts to fetch email addresses from Supabase Auth, but falls back to "unknown@unknown.com" when the call fails or doesn't return an email.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Email Fetching Logic
Modified the [admin-user-service.ts](file:///C:/Users/BILLA/Downloads/appwithpasswordchange%20(%20002)/lib/admin-user-service.ts) file to:

- Try to get the email from the profile data first as a fallback
- Improve error handling and logging
- Add better debugging information

### 2. Updated Methods
The following methods were updated:
- [getAllUsers()](file:///C:/Users/BILLA/Downloads/appwithpasswordchange%20(%20002)/lib/admin-user-service.ts#L45-L134)
- [getPendingUsers()](file:///C:/Users/BILLA/Downloads/appwithpasswordchange%20(%20002)/lib/admin-user-service.ts#L173-L216)
- [updateUser()](file:///C:/Users/BILLA/Downloads/appwithpasswordchange%20(%20002)/lib/admin-user-service.ts#L218-L272)

### 3. Improved Error Handling
Added better error messages and warnings to help diagnose issues:
- Log when auth API calls fail
- Log when emails are not found in auth
- Use profile email as fallback when available

## Additional Steps to Ensure Proper Functioning

### 1. Check Supabase Configuration
Ensure that the following environment variables are properly set:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 2. Verify Database Structure
Make sure the profiles table has an email column:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'profiles' AND column_name = 'email';
```

### 3. Check Supabase Auth Setup
Verify that users are properly created in the auth.users table and that the profiles table is correctly linked.

## Testing the Fix

1. Restart the development server
2. Navigate to the admin user management page
3. Check if real email addresses are now displayed instead of "unknown@unknown.com"
4. Check the browser console for any warning or error messages

## If Issues Persist

1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify Supabase credentials are correct
3. Ensure the user profiles have email data in the database
4. Check network tab to see if Supabase API calls are successful

## Files Modified

- [lib/admin-user-service.ts](file:///C:/Users/BILLA/Downloads/appwithpasswordchange%20(%20002)/lib/admin-user-service.ts) - Enhanced email fetching logic
- [scripts/test-email-fetching.ts](file:///C:/Users/BILLA/Downloads/appwithpasswordchange%20(%20002)/scripts/test-email-fetching.ts) - Test script
- [scripts/check-supabase-config.ts](file:///C:/Users/BILLA/Downloads/appwithpasswordchange%20(%20002)/scripts/check-supabase-config.ts) - Configuration checker

This fix should resolve the issue of "unknown@unknown.com" being displayed and allow real email addresses to load from the database.
